<case_creation>
Elastic Observability cases can be created by sending a POST request to the Kibana API. Ensure that you include the following in the POST body:
```POST kbn:/api/cases
{
"tags": [
"ai-assistant"
],
"owner": "observability",
"title": "<relevant-case-title>",
"settings": {
"syncAlerts": true
},
"connector": {
"id": "none",
"type": ".none",
"fields": null,
"name": "none"
},
"description": "<relevant-case-description>",
"customFields": [
]
}
```
</case_creation>

<case_updates>
You can find existing Elastic cases using the following API:
```
GET kbn:/api/cases/_find
```

This API return an array of cases (in the JSON field "cases") with the following fields of interest:
```
"id": "<id of alert>",
"status": "<open, in-progress, or closed>",
"title": "<title of case>",
"description": "<description of case>"
```

You should search for cases by roughly matching status (e.g., "open or in-progress"), title, and/or description. Once you find the case of interest, you can use the "id" field in subsequent APIs to update a case.

Updates to elastic cases can be created using the following API structure to add comments:
```
POST kbn:/api/cases/{caseId}/comments
{
  "type": "user",
  "owner": "observability",
  "comment": "<new-comment-markdown-supported>"
}
```

Or attach alerts to an existing case with the following API:
```
POST kbn:/api/cases/{caseId}/comments
{
  "type": "alert",
  "owner": "observability",
  "alertId": "<relevant-alert-id>",
  "index": "<relevant-alert-index>",
  "rule": {
    "id": "<alert-rule-id>",
    "name": "<alert-rule-name>"
  }
}
```
</case_updates>

<email_instructions>
1. **Use the Connector ID:**
   - Use the Elastic SMTP connector, which is named "Elastic-Cloud-SMTP" and has the ID `elastic-cloud-email`.
2. **Prepare the Email Parameters:**
   - Define the recipient's email address (`to`). This should be an array of email addresses.
   - Specify the subject of the email (`subject`). This should be a string.
   - Include the body of the email in the `message` field. This should also be a string.
3. **Execute the Connector:**
   - As an LLM, you should call the `execute_connector` function with the following parameters:
     - `id`: The connector ID (`elastic-cloud-email`).
     - `params`: An object containing:
       - `to`: An array of recipient email addresses.
       - `subject`: The subject of the email.
       - `message`: The body of the email.
   - Example function call format:
     execute_connector(
       id="elastic-cloud-email",
       params={
         "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
         "subject": "Your Email Subject",
         "message": "Your email content here."
       }
     )
   - Ensure all fields (`to`, `subject`, and `message`) are explicitly defined and correctly formatted to avoid validation errors.
4. **Handle Response:**
   - After making the function call, you should check the response to confirm the email was sent successfully.
   - If the email fails to send, examine any error messages and suggest corrections.
